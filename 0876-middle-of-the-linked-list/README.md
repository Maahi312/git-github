<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list">876. Middle of the Linked List</a></h2><h3>Easy</h3><hr><p>Given the <code>head</code> of a singly linked list, return <em>the middle node of the linked list</em>.</p>

<p>If there are two middle nodes, return <strong>the second middle</strong> node.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/23/lc-midlist1.jpg" style="width: 544px; height: 65px;" />
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> head = [1,2,3,4,5]
<strong>Output:</strong> [3,4,5]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The middle node of the list is node 3.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/23/lc-midlist2.jpg" style="width: 664px; height: 65px;" />
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
<strong>Output:</strong> [4,5,6]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The number of nodes in the list is in the range <code>[1, 100]</code>.</li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= Node.val &lt;= 100</code></li>
</ul>

# Approach

I am using the Two Pointers (Slow & Fast) technique here:

1. node1 â†’ slow pointer â†’ moves 1 step at a time

2. node2 â†’ fast pointer â†’ moves 2 steps at a time


---
At a particular not the node1 is decided as the middle node. Why it works as a middle node, because

1. Since node2 moves twice as fast as node1, by the time node2 reaches the end of the list,
node1 has covered half the distance â€” i.e., itâ€™s at the middle.

2. The loop stops when node2 or node2.next becomes None, ensuring we donâ€™t go beyond the listâ€™s end

# ðŸ’¡ In Summary

1. node1 â†’ moves one step (slow)

2. node2 â†’ moves two steps (fast)

3. When node2 reaches end â†’ node1 is in the middle

4. Works for both odd and even length lists
